    <h3>newModulesTest</h3>
	<p>
	This project has two pretend modules: pretendModule1,pretendModule2 that must be installed before it can be run.
	</p>
	<p>
	Before it was run you should have seen the system downloading the required modules.
	To test again delete "node_modules/pretendModule1" and "node_modules/pretendModule2" from the appjs-platform directory.
